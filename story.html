                            All it took was a match on everyone's favourite

                            where we could go. We decided to share our passion
                            for walking, and take Dan's over excitable dog, for
                            a walk to Rivington Pike.

                            After a brief 6 months of dating, Dan decided to
                            step up and ask the ultimate question, and asked
                            Emma to be his girlfriend. Which, with a massive
                            sigh of relief, she replied with "finally".

                        <h3>Moving day</h3>
                        <p>
                            One Christmas, Emma left Dan a small surprise in his
                            stocking, which was a happy sight to be seen. Emma
                            decided that she was ready to give him a key to her
                            house.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a few months, Thomas (the cat), gave the green
                            light to allow Dan to stay full time. By the summer
                            of 2022, Dan sold everything he owned, packed his
                            clothes and moved in with Emma and Thomas, with Odin
                            following not too far behind.

                        <h3>Time to take a knee</h3>
                        <p>
                            By Winter, Dan began his hunt for the perfect ring.
                            Luckily, he had plenty of inspiration to what Emma
                            liked, based off the million hints she had sent him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After asking and receiving her fathers blessing, Dan
                            began to think how he would go about asking Emma.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dan took Emma back to where they first walked,
                            driving up to Rivington on a clear night to "see the
                            stars". He put some music on in the car and asked
                            Emma to join him outside. He then proceeded to
                            nervously ask the question which, in his head, he
                            already knew the answer too. Thankfully, Dan read
                            the hints correctly, and Emma joyously said yes.
