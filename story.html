                            to where we could go. We decided to share our
                            passion for walking, and take Dan's over excitable
                            dog, for a walk to Rivington Pike.

                            After a brief 6 months of dating, Dan decided to
                            step up and ask the ultimate question, and asked
                            Emma to be his girlfriend. Which, with a massive
                            sigh of relief, she replied with "finally".

                        <p>
                            One Christmas, Emma left Dan a small gift under the
                            tree. This happened to be a key to her house, which
                            was a happy suprise for Dan.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After a few months, Dan began to start staying over
                            for longer than usual, 3-4 nights each week. That
                            was until the summer of 2022, when the decision was
                            made for Dan (and Odin), to move in full time.

                        <h3>Time to take a knee</h3>
                        <p>
                            After sending Dan what seems to have been hundreds
                            of Tiktoks of all sorts of wedding themed ideas, Dan
                            got the hint and decided the time was right to go
                            and buy a ring.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whilst in the Lake District with her family, Dan
                            cornered her Dad, John, and nervously asked for his
                            blessing to ask Emma to marry him. Thankfully, he
                            gave his approval and so the planning commenced on
                            how this would happen.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dan took Emma back to where they first walked,
                            driving up to Rivington on a clear night to "see the
                            stars". He put some music on in the car and asked
                            Emma to join him outside. He then proceeded to
                            nervously ask the question which, in his head, he
                            already knew the answer too. Thankfully, Dan read
                            the hints correctly, and Emma joyously said yes.
